# html5-bejeweled

This is a HTML5 video game made whilst reading the book "HTML5 Games: Creating Fun with HTML5, CSS3, and WebGL" by Jacob Seidelin.

# Setup

Just open `index.html` in the browser and you are ready to go.

# Warning

This repository is based on an already old book (from 2012) and uses old version of libraries (like Modernizr) with their deprecated features (like Modernizr.load() to load multiple JS scripts asynchrnously and execute a callback on success etc.). I didn't want to distract myself from reading and modernize (no pun intended) the code as I go. I might do this in the future when I finish reading the book. Replacing deprecated code, adding package management and build system, converting the code to ES6 etc. could be a nice programming workout.
